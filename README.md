 ##Description
 This is a game I coded in my high school Computational physics class.  The goal of the assignment was to program a computer game similar to a classic arcade style game, however we had to implement an accurate physics engine.  Every action needed to follow the laws of physics unlike most games.  To do this I programmed each arrow key to essentially “apply force” on the rocket, which in turn affects its acceleration, which then affects its velocity, instead of traditional games where the controller would affect the player’s velocity directly.
